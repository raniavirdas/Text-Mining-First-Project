# Text-Mining-First-Project
PubMed is a free digital full-text database of specialized scientific papers in the natural and biomedical sciences developed by the US National Library of Medicine (NLM). Not all articles contain abstracts, making it difficult for researchers to find the intended article. In this middle project, the predictions of the accuracy will be conducted in five labels target of PubMed articles using two features extraction (count vectorizer and n-grams) and two features weighting (Term Frequency(TF) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TFIDF)) with three experimental scenarios. Classification uses two machine learning methods, logistic regression and linear support vector machine (Linear SVM). The results show that the level of accuracy is quite high. However, the number of articles that do not contain abstracts is an obstacle that affects the accuracy of the results in the classification.
